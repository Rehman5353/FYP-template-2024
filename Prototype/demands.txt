Prototype

You will develop a small Web application which will have the following functionalities:

1. There will be a front-end GUI and a database in the back-end.

2. The front-end will have:

➤ A signup screen

> A login screen

➤ A screen to enter product info like... product id, product name, manufacturer's name, model etc.

a screen for entering search criteria

➤ a screen for displaying the results.

3. The back-end will have a database where:

> Login information of a registered user is saved.

> Product info is saved.

> Search results are saved.

4. When a user successfully signup, a welcome mail should be sent to HIS provided email. 5. User will enter the search criteria like... product name or company name etc.

6. Your business logic will search the webpage and displays the results.

It is strongly recommended that you use the same tools which are required for your final project.

This web application will help you in doing your final project.

In your prototype viva, you will be asked questions about your code you have written. So, you should know how your code is implementing your application's business logic.
